# Hi, I’m Liz! 🐈‍⬛✨

I'm an omni-stack developer currently working in the camera space, and learning what it means to be a contributor in open-source development. 

I love making things pretty, and I LOVE making processes easier for developers. Catch me finding answers and writing documentation any time I have a question, and find me hopping into spaces far away from low-level bit-banging to make a user-experience feel good. I thrive in environments where I can get my hands on all parts of the stack, and make an impact where gaps in knowledge, functionality, and quality of life are found. I've worked with many languages and tools over the past 10 years, including but not limited to Python, C/C++, Kotlin, Yocto, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Vue, and Swift.

## 🎸 Personal Interests
When I'm not coding, I like to strum the guitar, sing my favorite tunes, hang out with my cat Poe, watch cooking shows, and play video games (top faves of all time are: Animal Crossing New Horizons, Hades, and Baulder's Gate 3). 

## 🌟 Philosophy
Everyone is "Level One" at something, and it's just a matter of a little work and intrigue to get to "Level Two".
